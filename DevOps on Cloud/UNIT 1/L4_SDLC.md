*** 

- It is a systematic process for building software.
- It Ensures 
  - QUALITY
  - CORRECTNESS
- It has a detail plan,build and maintainence.

***

- ## WHY SDLC ?
  - ### It consist of different phases that go one by one and are dependent on each other in order to have an efficient and good software product at last. 
  - ### It also provides framework for standareds for each set of activities and also with different-different Delivery goals. 
  - ### It offers:- 
    - PROJECT PLANNNG
    - SCHEDULING AMD
    - ESTIMATING 
  - ### It is used for `PROJECT TRACKING AND CONTROL` 
  - ### it increases the visibliy of project planning 
  - ### It enhances the development speed because we develop a software step by step
  - ### It decreases project risk ,management and plan-over because `1.Planning -> 2.Building -> 3.Testing`.   

- ##  SDLC PHASES:-
  - ### REQUIREMENT COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
    - This is the clear picture of the entire project(WHAT,WHY AND HOW).
    - Senior Members they gather the inormation for the smooth conduct of project.
    - This stage requires a team to get details and precise requirements .
    - This helps companies to finalize the necessary timelines to finish the work of tha pirticular system/project. 
  - ### FEASIBILTY STUDY
    - This process is conducted with the help of  `SRS(Software requirement Specification)`. SRS is the complete and detalied desciption of what you are going to do in the project.
    - THERE A 5 TYPES OF FEASIBLITY CHECKS/STUDY THAT NEEDS O BE DONE:-
      - Economic : Can the project be completed in the budget
      - Legal : can you handle the project under the cyber laws.
      - Operation : This includes that can you be abl to create the operations which are expectede by the client.
      - Technical : This includes that weather your current software or the software you will develop in comming days will that projec will be fisible to that 
      - Schedule : Weather the project can be completed within the given schedule or not .      
  - ### DESIGN
    - Buleprint of the project is prepared which helps to design the overall architecture
    - THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DESIGN:-
      - High Level Design :- (Complete Description)
        - This is te brief dec. and,name and functionality of every module to be mentioned
        - This includes interrelationship and dependencies b/w modules.
        - Databse tables are identified along with their key element  
      - Low Level Design  : 
        - It incudes required information not complete info.
        - Addresses of all type ,listing of errors ,complete inp and o/p of each and every module is mentioned in Low level Design
  - ### CODING
    - Developers start to build the entire system by writing code.
    - Tasks are divided into into units and modules and assign it to diffrent developers
    - It is the longest phase.
    - Devlopers have to follow certain predefined rules.   
  - ### TESTING
    - Once the software is deployed the testing team starts the functionality of entire system 
    - This is done to check that the software is working according to customer requirement or not.
    - Each and every modules are tested by Quality analysis and testing team until the software is bug free,in stable condition and in working condition.
    -  
  - ### INSTALLATION/DEPLOYMENT
    - Project is ready for deployment. 
  - ### MAINTEANCE
    - 3 ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR DURING THIS PHASE 
      - Bug Fixing
      - Upgradation 
      - Enhancement:If Any
