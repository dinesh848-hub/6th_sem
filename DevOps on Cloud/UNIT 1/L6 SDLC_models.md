<h1 align="center"> SDLC Models</h1>
 
***

- ## WATERFALL MODEL :-
  - This was widely accepted SDLC model
  - In this the development of software is divided into various phases.
  - The outcome of one phase is acted as input for another phase .
  - It is a documentation intensive model

- ## INCREMENTAL MODEL :-
  - In this the series of waterfall model were there.
  - The req. were divided into group at the start of project and for each group the sdlc model was followed to a development software
  - The SDLC process was seperated with each release adding more functionality until all requirements were met.
  - Modifications to incrimental model allowed the development cycle to overlap with the preveious one  
  - Subsequent cycle they had to begun before the previous cycle was actually complete. //not understod😐 

- ## V MODEL IN SDLC :-
- ## AGILE MODEL
  - In this model the entire project was divded into small incrimental builds and the development team and the testing team was in continious inetraction with each other that led to be a good development model.
- ## SPIRAL MODEL
  - This was initially and now a RISK driven model
  - this helps team to adapts models from one or more process models.
  - This adopts the best features of the prototyping in Concurrency,design and development activities.     


> # Agile model was not that much continious which led to the development of `DevOps`.
