### The development of software engineering led to the development of `SDLC` after which came `Agile`
- # GENERAL TERMS :
   - ## What is Software :
      - It is a piece of executable code that serves some computational purpose  
   - ## What is software product :
      - Once a software is ready we call it as software product 
   - ## What is Software engineering :
      - Anlysing of user requirements then,  
      - Designing is done then, 
      - Building is done and at last
      - Testing is done.
   - ## General defination of Software Engineering according to IEEE :
      - S.E is the Application of a systematic disciplined quantitable approach to the development operation & Maintinance of a software

- # üëâSOFTWARE CRISIS & üó£Ô∏èSOLUTION OF IT
 
   |YEAR|DESCRIPTION|
   |-|-|
   |‚è≥Late 1960's|üëâ Many software programs failed or became over budget and output was unreliable 
   ||üëâ Larger softwares were quite expensive to maintain |
   ||üëâ Lots of software were not able to fullfill growing requirements of customers|
   ||üëâ Complexity of software products increaassd|
   ||üëâ Hardware capablities increased|
   |‚≠ê Solution to these problems was S.E|Engineeering models came into existance to help companies|
   |‚è≥Late 1970's|üó£Ô∏è It showed widespread use of software engineering|
   |‚è≥Late 1980's|üó£Ô∏è Automation of S.E process and C.A.S.E`(Compuer aided software engineering)`came into existance|
   |‚è≥Late 1990's|üó£Ô∏è Increase emphasis on management of softwares and quality.It is popular becuase as size of software becomes large S.E helps to build the software|
   |‚≠ê|Cycles and models that are able to furnish properly as to how the software has to be maintained and even if there is new requirement then also because if s.E software developers are able to meeet the requirements.|
   |‚≠ê|As the size of software increase it is directly proportional to engineering helps in building the sftware|
   |‚≠ê|It's easy to recreate new software to scale with the existing .It was much easy for developers to help and merge with these requirements.|

- # CHALLENGES RELATED TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
   - ## In saftey critical areas such as space,nuclear power plants the cost of S.E is massive because the lifes are at risk.
   - ## Increase market demand for fast `TURN AROUND TIME`
  > ## ‚≠ê This led to the development of `Azile` and `DevOps`.
   - ## Dealing with increased complexity of soft. that was the need for new applications. 
   - ## Diversity of software system should be communicating with each other.
- # CHARACTERSTICS OF A GOOD SOFTWARE
   - ## OPERATIONAL
      - ### It lets us know how well a software works when it's in operation 
      - ### Certain points that can be taken into consideration are:-
         -  BUDGET :   
         -  EFFICIENCY :
         -  USABLITY : 
         -  SECURITY : 
         -  DEPENDABLITY : 
         -  CORRECTNESS OF CAUSE : 
         -  SAFTEY : 
         -  FUNCTIONALITY :
   - ## TRANSITIONAL
      - ### How the software is moved from one platform to another platform.
      - ### Is it dependent or independent?
      - ### ATTRIBUTES ARE:-
         - INTEROPERBILITY : 
         - REUSABLITY : 
         - PORTABLITY : 
         - ADAPTABLITY :    
   - ## MAINTENANCE
      - ### This aspect talk about how well a software has capablity to adapt itself in quickly changing environment.
      - ### GENERAL ATTRIBUTES ARE:-
         - FLEXIBLITY : 
         -  MAINAINABLITY : 
         -  MODULARITY :
         -  SCALABLITY :
