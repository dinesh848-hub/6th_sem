HTML tables allow us to arrange data into rows and columns.

The <table> tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.

The <td> elements are the data containers of the table.They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.

By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered. 

By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.
